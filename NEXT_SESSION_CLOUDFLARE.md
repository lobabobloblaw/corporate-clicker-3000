## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Discord Activity fully built and tested
- All code optimized for mobile (iOS/Android safe areas)
- Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages created
- Error boundary and performance optimizations
- Git repository initialized and committed
- Cloudflare Pages configuration files created (`_headers`, `_redirects`)
- All code ready to push to GitHub

### üìç Current Location
Working directory: `/Users/alexvoigt/Documents/GPT-5/discord_webapi`

### üéØ Next Steps
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Push code to GitHub
3. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

## Background

**Problem**: Current HTTPS URL is a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel with random name:
- `https://conceptual-americans-investigation-mpeg.trycloudflare.com`
- This URL changes when server restarts (not permanent)

**Solution**: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
- Get permanent URL like: `https://corporate-clicker-3000.pages.dev`
- Free, fast, automatic deployments
- Never changes, professional-looking
